# Ray Tracing In One Weekend

My Implementation (Rust) of RTIOWE ([_Ray Tracing in One
Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html))

### What is this

A simple ray-tracer using raylib for visualization. Follows "Ray Tracing In One
Weekend". I implemented up to "metal" rendering. I skipped dialetrics since for
my intents it was not relevant, and I also skipped positional camera since I have
implemented something similar in [Rayz](https://github.com/SamuelYvon/rayz).
